The arrow functions that weâ€™ve seen so far were very simple. 
They took arguments from the left of =>, evaluated and returned the right-side expression with them.
Sometimes we need a more complex function, with multiple expressions and statements.
 In that case, we can enclose them in curly braces.
 The major difference is that curly braces require a return within them to return a value (just like a regular function does).
